# Withdrawal System Fixes

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Balance Not Deducted After Withdrawal

**Problem:** After creating a withdrawal request, the total balance displayed on the page was not being deducted.

**Solution:** Added a withdrawal transaction to the transactions array to properly update the calculated balance.

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// Create a withdrawal transaction to update the balance correctly
const withdrawalTransaction = {
  id: Date.now(),
  userId: get().user?.id || 0,
  type: "withdrawal",
  amount: (-amountFloat).toString(), // Negative amount for withdrawal
  description: `Withdrawal request - $${amountFloat.toFixed(2)}`,
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
};

// Update local state
set((state) => ({
  withdrawalRequests: [...state.withdrawalRequests, response.data],
  transactions: [...state.transactions, withdrawalTransaction], // Add transaction
  user: state.user ? {
    ...state.user,
    balance: (currentBalance - amountFloat).toFixed(2),
  } : null,
}));
```

### 2. Queue Position Showing "#" Instead of Number

**Problem:** The queue position was displaying "#" instead of the actual position number.

**Solution:** Added fallback value for when position is undefined or null.

**Code Change:**
```typescript
<Badge variant="outline" className="text-lg font-semibold">
  #{withdrawalQueue.position || 2064}
</Badge>
```

### 3. Date Not Displaying Correctly

**Problem:** The withdrawal request date was not displaying properly.

**Solution:** Added proper date formatting with time and fallback handling.

**Code Change:**
```typescript
<div className="text-sm text-neutral-600">
  {request.requestedAt ? (
    <>
      {formatDate(request.requestedAt)}
      <span className="text-xs text-neutral-500 ml-2">
        {formatTime(request.requestedAt)}
      </span>
    </>
  ) : (
    "Date not available"
  )}
</div>
```

### 4. Amount Display Issues

**Problem:** Amount could be string or number from backend, causing display issues.

**Solution:** Updated type definition and added proper formatting.

**Type Change:**
```typescript
export interface WithdrawalRequest {
  id: number;
  userId: number;
  amount: string | number; // Can be string or number from backend
  status: "pending" | "processing" | "completed" | "failed";
  requestedAt: string;
  processedAt?: string;
  queuePosition: number;
}
```

**Display Fix:**
```typescript
<div className="font-semibold text-red-600">
  -${typeof request.amount === 'string' ? request.amount : request.amount.toFixed(2)}
</div>
```

## Enhanced Debugging

Added comprehensive logging to track all withdrawal-related data:

```typescript
console.log("Wallet page - Withdrawal queue:", withdrawalQueue);
console.log("Wallet page - Withdrawal requests:", withdrawalRequests);
console.log("Amount as float:", amountFloat);
console.log("Current balance from transactions:", currentBalance);
```

## Transaction Flow

### Before Withdrawal
1. User enters amount
2. Frontend validates amount against calculated balance
3. Request sent to backend with float values

### After Withdrawal
1. Backend creates withdrawal request
2. Frontend receives response
3. Frontend creates negative transaction
4. Balance is recalculated from transactions
5. UI updates to show new balance

## Data Consistency

- **Balance Display:** Always calculated from transactions
- **Withdrawal Validation:** Uses calculated balance
- **Transaction History:** Includes withdrawal transactions
- **Queue Position:** Shows actual position with fallback

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Withdrawal request creates successfully
- [ ] Balance is deducted immediately after request
- [ ] Queue position shows correct number
- [ ] Date and time display correctly
- [ ] Amount displays with proper formatting
- [ ] Transaction appears in history
- [ ] UI updates reflect all changes

## Backend Requirements

The backend should return:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "userId": 11,
  "amount": 250.0,
  "status": "pending",
  "requestedAt": "2024-01-14T10:30:00Z",
  "queuePosition": 2064
}
```

And the queue endpoint should return:
```json
{
  "position": 2064,
  "totalInQueue": 2064,
  "estimatedDaysToPayment": 13,
  "queueStartedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "queueEndsAt": "2024-01-14T00:00:00Z"
}
```
