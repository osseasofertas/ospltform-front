# Premium Payment Redirect Implementation

## Change Made

**Request:** When users click "Become Premium", redirect them to the SpeedSellX payment page instead of calling the backend API.

## Implementation

### Updated Function

**Before:**
```typescript
const handleBecomePremium = async () => {
  setIsBecomingPremium(true);
  try {
    await becomePremiumReviewer();
    toast({
      title: "Premium reviewer activated",
      description: "You are now a premium reviewer with queue advantages!",
    });
  } catch (error) {
    toast({
      title: "Premium activation failed",
      description: "Failed to activate premium reviewer status.",
      variant: "destructive",
    });
  } finally {
    setIsBecomingPremium(false);
  }
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const handleBecomePremium = () => {
  // Redirect to SpeedSellX payment page
  window.open('https://pay.speedsellx.com/689167756DA4E', '_blank');
  
  toast({
    title: "Redirecting to payment",
    description: "You will be redirected to complete your premium membership purchase.",
  });
};
```

### Updated Button

**Before:**
```typescript
<Button
  onClick={handleBecomePremium}
  disabled={isBecomingPremium}
  className="w-full bg-yellow-600 hover:bg-yellow-700 text-white"
>
  {isBecomingPremium ? "Activating..." : "Become Premium"}
</Button>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<Button
  onClick={handleBecomePremium}
  className="w-full bg-yellow-600 hover:bg-yellow-700 text-white"
>
  Become Premium
</Button>
```
